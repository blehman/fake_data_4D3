#Fake Data
This data is not real and is simply available for visualization practice.

###Fake Data Structure
1.  line_counts_clusterID.csv - the last column is the cluster label.
    The preceeding 14 columns are boolean values that represent the
presences of the features.  
2.  cluster\#\_results - additional information for each cluster.
